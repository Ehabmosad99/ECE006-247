	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>An operating system is a software that manages the computer hardware. The hardware must provide appropriate to make sure the right operation of the pc system and to forestall user programs from interfering with the right operation of the system.<br> An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and hardware. The aim of an operating system is to supply an environment during which a user can execute programs in an exceedingly convenient and efficient manner.</p>
	<ul>
			<li>An operating system is a program that controls the execution of application programs and acts as an interface between the user of a computer and the computer hardware.</li>
			<li>An operating system is concerned with the allocation of resources and services, such as memory, processors, devices, and information. The operating system correspondingly includes programs to manage these resources, such as a traffic controller, a scheduler, memory management module, I/O programs, and a file system.</li>
			<li>A more common definition is that the software system is that the one program running in any respect times on the pc (usually called the kernel), with all else being application programs. </li>
